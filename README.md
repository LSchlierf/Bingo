# Buzzword Bingo React app

This is the code for my buzzword bingo website, which is available [here](https://bs-bingo.vercel.app).

## Usage

On the main page, you add a set using the `+` button. Enter a title for the set, and 25 or more entries, again using the `+` button. Then return to the main page using the left arrow button.  
Press the newly created bingo set and you will be taken to a newly created bingo card. Here, you can mark off fields and will be notfied when you finish your bingo card.  
To pause a game, return to the main page using the left arrow button. Here, you will see all your saved sets and paused games.
